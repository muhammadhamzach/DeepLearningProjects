# YOLO Keras Implementation

* main.py is used to call this program
* User can input any image to be resolved at line 20 in main.py from images folder or can add their own images in that respective folder

## Note
* yolo.h5 file isnt included in this project. Instructions from where to download are in the model_data/readme.md file

## Warning
* code doesnt work with TF 2.x because of space_to_depth function inavalibility. 

# Reference
* Heavily adopted from the convolutional neural network course on deeplearning.ai
