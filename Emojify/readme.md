# Emojify 

* main.py is used to run this project
* A dataset for training on 5 types of emojis is already provided and loaded.
* These 5 emojis are hear, baseball, smile, disappointed and fork & knives
* User can add more emojis using the emoji library to the emoji disctonary in the label_to_emoji.py file
* If to train on more emojis & their sentences, user also has to add more sentences in the train data file so he algorithm will know how to react (in addition to the emoji entry in dictonary)
* To check the response of the code to a sentence, user can input a sentence in line 20 in main.py and see for their selves.
