# L-Layer Convolutional Neural Network Using Tensorflow

* dataset is provided which is automatically loaded up on startup
* main.py is used to execue the scripts
* Relu & maxpool Function pair is used to calculate the forward propagation convolutional part 
* The number of convolutional layers is decided by user
* strides and ksize (for pooling) is also decided by user
* Used Xavier Initilization of parameters
* Can use both Gradient Descent as "gd" & Adam Optimization as "adam" (including its params beta1, beta2, optimizer) as an update optimization parameter rule
* Learning Rate, No of Iterations and Mini-Batch/Full Batch Gradient Descent can be user selected

## Note
* This script is backward compatible to Tensorflow v1.x

## Reference
* This script is derived from the deeplearning.ai Convolutional Network course
