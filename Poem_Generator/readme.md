# Shakespeare Poem Generator (based on LSTM)

* main.py is used to generate output
* user is required to input a seed sentence
* For Shakespear Learning, a txt file and already-made and saved model is provided but the code will run on any text. User just need to provide the required text file and a pre-made model (though model is optional, if model.h5 is unavailable, user can uncomment line 32-37 of main.py and comment line 30-31 and an LSTM model will be made)
* Two different shaespear models are provided for user to use.
